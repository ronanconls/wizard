    <h2>About Us</h2>
    
    <p>The Wizard academy is a comforting and excellent place for those with wizardly powers to grow and strengthen their ancestral gifts! We have schools 
        in all the major elements, our main campus is on Wizard city, but for Balance students you will have to travel to the world of Krokotopia to see your professor! 
        In addition we have houses and dormitories for all students! 
        Our staff of accomplished and experienced professors will guide our students on the right path on their 
        journey to gain more spells and power. The head master of our academy is Head Master Ambrose (the old guy in with the cane!). </p>
